# The National Phenocam Network: http://phenocam.sr.unh.edu/webcam/

Per Brian Miller: "We’ve supported the deployment of 11 of the cameras: poudreriver, cperuvb, nationalelkrefuge, grandteton, grandrivergrass, ash bottoms, bozeman, ninemileprairie, oakville, usgseros, quickbird. FYI, Colin Talbert is developing python scripts for extracting NDVI from these images, and cross-walking between the PhenoCam images and Landsat 8 pixels."

The example here is from oakville, which had a continuous set of RGB and IR images from May-Dec 2015. Photos were downloaded for one entire day every two weeks between May 1 and Dec 11, 2015. This should capture much of the diurnal and seasonal variability; more photos can be downloaded from the network.
