Where the old dune occurs one finds mature oak, magnolia and cedar. Pine and bay predominate in areas that have been disturbed by clearing and fire. There are numerous invasive species, most notably Brazilian Pepper (Schinus sp.). We are in agricultural hardiness Zone 9a and generally enjoy several additional degrees of protection from cold weather due to the proximity of surrounding warm waters. The freezing weather of Feb 2009 was hard on most vegetation as we had several consecutive days of 8 or more hours of hard freeze. I have noted very few butterflies and less abundance of other common insects, most probably due to demise during the freezing weather. [This note written March 20, 2009]","","43","279",""
