# Sweden NPN phenology data from Kjell Bolmgren 

From Kjell regarding historical data:
> Here is ... a sample from the Swedish NPN historical database. This subset is the one we use for our national reference model and therefore only include  a few species+phase combinations. 

> The data has not been formally published yet (in prep.), so there is no official metadata file, but I listed a few things in the attached excel-file. I included one column that includes Swedish characters. I hope that does not corrupt the cvs-file.

From Kjell regarding present-day data:
> [Data] from SWE-NPN’s present-day motoring network ... adds the perspective of (i) data from ’anonymous’ observers and (ii) a suggested development of the BBCH code including ’-1’ = ’not yet’ observations.
