Data Product Description
This data product contains the quality-controlled, native sampling resolution data from NEON'splant diversity sampling protocol. Plant diversity is sampled once or twice per year by NEON field technicians at core and relocatable sites. Sampling is based on plant phenology, with timing of sampling targeted to occur during a 1-2 month period surrounding peak phenology (when most species are flowering).  Sites with more than one peak may be sampled twice per year. Plant presence is tallied each of 3-45 400m^2 plots in each NEON site, depending on site size. Each plot includes 8 1m^2, 8 10m^2, and 4 100m^2 nested subplots. Data collected in 1m^2 subplots includes ocular estimates of plant cover and the cover of abiotic variables, whereas the larger plots contain only species lists.  For additional details on protocol, see the TOS Protocol and Procedure: Plant Diversity Sampling. Products resulting from this sampling include vascular plant species identification, height, and cover of abiotic variables, non-vascular plants and dead plant material.

File naming convention for NEON observation systems data files: NEON.DOM.SITE.DPL.PRNUM.REV.DESC, where:
- NEON denotes the organizational origin of the data product and identifies the product as operational; data collected as part of a special data collection exercise are designated by a separate, unique alphanumeric code created by the PI
- DOM is a three-character alphanumeric code, referring to the domain of data acquisition (D01 � D20)
- SITE is four-character alphanumeric code, referring to the site of data acquisition; all sites are designated by a standardized four-character alphabetic code
- DPL is a three-character alphanumeric code, referring to data product processing level
- PRNUM is a five-character numeric code, referring to the data product number (see the Data Product Catalog at http://data.neoninc.org/data-product-catalog)
- REV is a three-digit designation, referring to the revision number of the data product; it is also used to track �Data Product Maturity�, from Engineering �Grade/Provisional to Science-Grade (001 = initial REV, Engineering-Grade or Provisional; 101 = initial REV, Science-Grade)
- DESC is an abbreviated description of the data product

These data are considered provisional (created using a baseline algorithm approach with a minimal or reduced set of QA/QC checks). Minor updates to the QA/QC and processing algorithms will occur during construction (prior to 2017). Changes to provisional data products will occur on an as-needed basis. Please check back to this site for updates tracked in change logs. Query reproducibility on provisional data cannot be guaranteed.  

Change log:
04/03/2015: There is a known bug whereby a portion of the data may be omitted from the post to the database, resulting in an incomplete set of records presented on the portal.  This issue affects data from the following sites:HARV, SCBI. [Resolved 4/19/2015]
01/07/2015: There is a known bug whereby the scientificName and taxonRank values in the data may show the scientificName of a synonym rather than that associated with the accepted taxonomy.  We are working to resolve this as quickly as possible.  In the meantime, it is recommended that data users work with the taxonID, not scientificName.  The correct scientificName and taxonRank associated with each taxonID can be found in NEON_pla_taxonomy.zip. [Resolved 4/29/2015]
