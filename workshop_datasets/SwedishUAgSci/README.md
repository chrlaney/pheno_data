# Data from the Swedish University of Agricultural Sciences

From Kjell:
> This one is unfortunately in Swedish and a bit complex. It is from the field forestry stations at my university. The interesting perspectives are that they (i) in one case measure shoot development in millimeters, (ii) in one case use the Krutzsch index for needed tree shoot development/elongation, and (iii) measure phenology development by calculating number of flowering shoots per square meter.

> Unfortunately, the headers etc in the excel-file and the instructions in the pdf are in Swedish.
